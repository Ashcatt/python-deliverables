2. Congratulations, you are the new owner of a local coffee shop! Just one problem
your employees take four minutes to serve each customer. You peer out from the
storeroom and notice that the line is getting long. Write a program that prompts
for the number of people currently in line, and outputs the time it will take to
serve everyone whoâ€™s waiting.

    # User input
    customers = eval(input("How many people are in line? "))
    # Calculate, number of customers x time 
    time = customers * 4
    # Outcome
