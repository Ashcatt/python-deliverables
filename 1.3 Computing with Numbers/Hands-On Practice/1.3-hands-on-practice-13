13. Write a program to sum a series of numbers entered by the user. The program should first
prompt the user for how many numbers are to be summed. The program should then prompt
the user for each of the numbers in turn and print out a total sum after all the numbers have
been entered. Hint: Use an input statement in the body of the loop.

# This program finds the sum of (amount) numbers.

def main():
    
    # Program description
    print("This program finds the sum of numbers")

    # User input, amount of numbers to be added together
    amount = eval(input("How many numbers are to be summed? "))

    # Defines variable value
    math = 0

    # Loop (amount) times
    for i in range(amount):
        n = eval(input("Enter a number: "))
        math = math + n

    # Outcome
    print("The sum of your",amount,"numbers is",math)
main()
