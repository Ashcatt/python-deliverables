    print("Let's calculate the cost of a pizza per square inch!")
    # Asks user for the pizza's diameter
    diameter = eval(input("Enter the pizza's diameter: "))
    # Asks user for the pizza's price
    pizzaPrice = eval(input("Enter the price of the pizza: $"))
    # Calculates the area of the pizza by using the diameter to find the radius
    area = math.pi * (diameter / 2) ** 2
    # Divides price by the area to get the pizza's price per square inch
    ppsi = pizzaPrice / area
    # Conclusion, displays price per square inch rounded to the second decimal place as cents
    print("The price per square inch is $" + str(round(ppsi, 2)))
