13. Write a program to sum a series of numbers entered by the user. The program should first
prompt the user for how many numbers are to be summed. The program should then prompt
the user for each of the numbers in turn and print out a total sum after all the numbers have
been entered. Hint: Use an input statement in the body of the loop.

# This program finds the average of a series of numbers.

def main():

    # Program description
    print("This program finds the average of a series of numbers")

    # The amount of times the loop will repeat
    loopFor = eval(input("How many numbers will you enter? "))
    
    # Sets variable start value
    total = 0
    
    # Loop
    for i in range(loopFor):
        # The operator += adds the input to the variable, total
        total += eval(input("Enter a number: "))
        
    # Calculates average
    math = total / loopFor

    # Conclusion
    print("The average of your",loopFor,"numbers is",float(math))
main()
