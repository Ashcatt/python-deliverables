# This program calculates the volume and surface area of a sphere, given it's radius.

# Makes the math library available
import math
def main():	
       # Program Desc
    print("Let's calculate the volume and surface area of a sphere"
    # User input request for sphere radius
    rad = eval(input("Enter the radius of the sphere: "))
    # Calculates volume of the sphere
    vol = (4 / 3) * math.pi * rad ** 3
    # Calculates the Surface area of the sphere
    sa = 4 * math.pi * rad ** 2
    # Displays answers rounded to the second decimal
    print("Volume:",round(vol, 2))
    print("Surface Area:",round(sa, 2))
main()
