# this program finds the distance between two grid points

# Makes the math library available
import math
def main():
    # Desc
    print("This program finds the distance between two points")
    # Asks user for two coordinate grid points
    x1, y1 = eval(input("Enter the first grid point: "))
    x2, y2 = eval(input("Enter the second grid point: "))
    # Uses distance formula to find distance
    distance = math.sqrt(((x2 - x1) ** 2) + ((y2 - y1) ** 2))
    # Prints outcome of the formula
    print("The distance between these two points is",distance)
main()
