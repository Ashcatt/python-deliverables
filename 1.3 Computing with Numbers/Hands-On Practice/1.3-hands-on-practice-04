between the flash and the sound of thunder. The speed of sound is approximately 1100 ft/sec
and 1 mile is 5280 ft.

# This program evaluates the distance of a lightning strike.

def main():
    # Desc
    print("This program calculates the distance of a lightning strike.")
    # Time elapsed
    time = eval(input("How much time, in seconds, has elapsed? "))
    # calculates distance by converting the time seconds into miles away
    distance = time * (1100 / 5200)
    # Conclusion, rounded to the second decimal
    print("The lightning strike is",round(distance, 2),"miles away")
main()
