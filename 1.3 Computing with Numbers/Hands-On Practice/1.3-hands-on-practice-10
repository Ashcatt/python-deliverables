10. Write a program to determine the length of a ladder required to reach
a given height when leaned against a house. The height and angle of the
ladder are given as inputs. To compute length use:
length=heightsin angle
Note: The angle must be in radians. Prompt for an angle in degrees and use this formula to convert: 
radians=180degrees

# This program calculates the length required of a ladder for it to reach a given height when leaned against a house.

# Makes library available
import math
def main():
    
    # Description
    print("This program calculates the required length of a ladder to reach a given height when leaned against a house.")
    
    # User value input
    height = eval(input("What is the height of the ladder in ft? "))
    angle = eval(input("What is the angle measure in degrees? "))
    
    # Calculates length
    radian = math.pi / 180 * angle
    length = height / math.sin(radian)
    
    # Final answer
    print("The required length is",length,"ft")
main()
