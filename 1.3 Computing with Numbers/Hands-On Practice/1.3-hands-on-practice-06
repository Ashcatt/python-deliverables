6. Two points in a plane are specified using the coordinates (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). Write a program
that calculates the slope of a line through two (non-vertical) points entered by the user.

# This program finds the slope between two grid points.

def main():
    # Desc
    print("This program determines the slope of the line between two nonvertical coordinate points")
    # Asks user for the two grid points
    x1, y1 = eval(input("Enter the first grid point: "))
    x2, y2 = eval(input("Enter the second grid point: "))
    # Uses the slope formula to find the slope of the points
    slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 -x1)
    # Prints slope
    print("The slope of this line is",slope)
main()
