3. Write a program that computes the molecular weight of a carbohydrate (in grams per mole)
based on the number of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen atoms in the molecule. The program
should prompt the user to enter the number of hydrogen atoms, the number of carbon atoms,
and the number of oxygen atoms.

# This program calculates the molecular weight of a carb
# based on the amount of atoms the user specifies.

def main():
    # Desc
    print("This program calculates the molecular weight in grams/mole of a ")
    print("carbohydrate based on the amount of atoms you choose.")
    print("")
    # Atom amount, user input
    h = eval(input("Enter the number of Hydrogen atoms: "))
    c = eval(input("Enter the number of Carbon atoms: "))
    o = eval(input("Enter the number of Oxygen atoms: "))
    molecularWeight = (h * 1.00794) + (c * 12.0107) + (o * 15.9994)
    print("")
    print("The total weight of this carbohydrate")
    print("is",molecularWeight,"grams per mole.")
