3. Write a program that computes the molecular weight of a carbohydrate (in grams per mole)
based on the number of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen atoms in the molecule. The program
should prompt the user to enter the number of hydrogen atoms, the number of carbon atoms,
and the number of oxygen atoms.

    # Asks user for the amount of atoms
    h = eval(input("Enter the number of Hydrogen atoms: "))
    c = eval(input("Enter the number of Carbon atoms: "))
    o = eval(input("Enter the number of Oxygen atoms: "))
    # Calculates the molecular weight by multiplying the amount
    # of each atom by its weight and then adding them all together
    molecularWeight = (h * 1.00794) + (c * 12.0107) + (o * 15.9994)
