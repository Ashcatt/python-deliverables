16. A Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where each successive
number is the sum of the previous two. The classic Fibonacci sequence
begins: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, . . . . Write a program that compute
s the nth Fibonacci number where n is a value input by the user.
For example, if n = 6, then the result is 8.
