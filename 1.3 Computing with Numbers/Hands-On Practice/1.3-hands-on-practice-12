# This program finds the sum of the cubes of the first n, user specified variable, natural numbers.

def main():

    # Program description
    print("This program finds the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers")

    # User input, value of n
    n = eval(input("Enter the value of n: "))

    # Set variables to their starting value
    sum = 0
    repeat = 1
    
    # Loop to find sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers
    for i in range(n):
        # Adds the cube of the number to the sum
        sum = sum + (repeat ** 3)
        # Adds 1 to repeat each time it loops
        repeat = repeat + 1

    # Conclusion
    print("The sum is",sum)
main()
