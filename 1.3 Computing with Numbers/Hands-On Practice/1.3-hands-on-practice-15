15. Write a program that approximates the value of pi by summing the terms
of this series: 4/1- 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + 4/9- 4/11 + . . . The program should
prompt the user for n, the number of terms to sum, and then output the sum
of the first n terms of this series. Have your program subtract the
approximation from the value of math.pi to see how accurate it is.
