14. Word Count. A common utility on Unix/Linux systems is a small program called ''wc." 
This program analyzes a file to determine the number of lines, words, and characters contained therein.
Write your own version of wc. The program should accept a filename as input and then
print three numbers showing the count of lines, words, and characters in the file.

# File: 2.1-hands-on-practice-14
# Made 1.16.19 by Ksenia Z
# This program finds the lines, words and chars the file name input by the user.

def wordcount(fileName):
    content = list(open(fileName, 'r')) # adds content into list

    # set variables
    lines = 0
    words = 0
    ch = 0
    
    for line in content:
        lines += 1 # +1 line for every line
        words += len(line.split(" ")) # Finds word number by splitting the lines in content by spaces
        ch += len(line) # Finds chars by finding the length in characters of each line
        
    print("lines:",lines,"\nwords:",words,"\ncharacters:",ch) # Outcome
    
wordcount("1.py") # Requires user to input the parameter while calling the function
