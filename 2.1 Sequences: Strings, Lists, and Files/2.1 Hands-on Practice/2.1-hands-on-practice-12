12. Write an improved version of the futval.py program from Chapter 2. Your program will prompt the user
for the amount of the investment, the annualized interest rate, and the number of years of the investment.
The program will then output a nicely formatted table that tracks the value of the investment year by year.
Your output might look something like this:

Year 	Value
--------------------------
0 	$2000.00
1 	$2200.00
2 	$2420.00
3 	$2662.00
4 	$2928.20
5 	$3221.02
6 	$3542.12
7 	$3897.43

        print("{0}      ${1}".format(i+1,principal)) # output
