15. Write a program to draw a quiz score histogram. Your program should read data from a file.
Each line of the file contains a number in the range 0 - 10. Your program must count the
number of occurrences of each score and then draw a vertical bar chart with a bar for
each possible score (0 - 10) with a height corresponding to the count of that score. 
For example, if 15 students got an 8, then the height of the bar for 8 should be 15. 
Hint: Use a list that stores the count for each possible score. An example histogram is shown below:
