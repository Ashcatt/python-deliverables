15. Write a program to plot a horizontal bar chart of student exam scores. Your program should get input
from a file. The first line of the file contains the count of the number of students in the file, and each
subsequent line contains a student's last name followed by a score in the range 0-100. Your program should
draw a horizontal rectangle for each student where the length of the bar represents the student's score.
The bars should all line up on their left-hand edges. Hint: Use the number of students to determine the
size of the window and its coordinates. Bonus: label the bars at the left end with the students' names.
