5. Numerologists claim to be able to determine a person's character traits based on the "numeric value" of a name.
The value of a name is determined by summing up the values of the letters of the name
where "a" is 1 "b" is 2 "c" is 3 up to "z" being 26 For example the name "Zelle" would have
the value 26 + 5 + 12 + 12 + 5 = 60 (which happens to be a very auspicious number, by the way). 
Write a program that calculates the numeric value of a single name provided as input.
--------
# File: 2.1-hands-on-practice-05
# Made 1.7.19 by Ksenia Z
# Calculates the numerical value of a name.

def main():
    print("This program finds the numerical value of a name") # Desc
    name_str = input("Enter a name: ") # Get name

    name_value = 0 # Set variable
    for ch in name_str:
        e = (ord(ch.lower())-96)
        name_value += e
    print("The numerical value is",name_value)
main()
