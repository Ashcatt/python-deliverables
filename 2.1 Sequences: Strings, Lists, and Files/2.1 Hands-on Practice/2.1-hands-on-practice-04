4. An acronym is a word formed by taking the first letters of the words in a phrase and making a word from them.
For example, RAM is an acronym for "random access memory." Write a program that allowsthe user to type in a phrase
and then outputs the acronym for that phrase. Note: The acronym should be all uppercase, even if the words in the
phrase are not capitalized.

def main():
