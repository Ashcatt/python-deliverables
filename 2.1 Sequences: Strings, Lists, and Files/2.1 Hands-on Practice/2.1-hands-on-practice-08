8. One problem with the previous exercise is that it does not deal with the case when
we "drop off the end" of the alphabet.A true Caesar cipher does the shifting in a
circular fashion where the next character after "z" is "a." Modify your solution
to the previous problem to make it circular. You may assume that the input
consists only of letters and spaces. Hint: Make a string containing all the characters
of your alphabet and use positions in this string as your code. You do not have
to shift "z" into "a"; just make sure that you use a circular shift over the entire
sequence of characters in your alphabet string.
