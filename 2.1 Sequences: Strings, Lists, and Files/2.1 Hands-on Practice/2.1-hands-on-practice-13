13. Redo one of the previous programming problems to make them batch-oriented
(using text files for input and output)
--------
# File: 2.1-hands-on-practice-13
# Made 1.15.19 by Ksenia Z
# An edited version of 1.3-hands-on-practice-05 to make it batch-oriented.

# Note: The files, parameter and return_value, must be manually created in the same folder as this program
# for the program to work correctly. Values must be entered into the parameter file first, then the return_value
# file will hold the output after the program is run

def main():
    # Create files | Note: read, (overwrite)write, apppend, + creates file
    parameter = open("parameter","r")
    return_value = open("return_value","w")
    
    # the variable, lb, is set equal to the first line in the file, parameter, linked to the variable, parameter
    lb = parameter.readline()

    # Calculate
    total = (int(lb) * 10.5) + (int(lb) * .86) + 1.5
    
    # Sends output to file
    print(str(total),file=return_value)

    # Close files
    parameter.close()
    return_value.close()
main()
