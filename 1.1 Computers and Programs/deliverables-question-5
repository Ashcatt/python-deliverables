5. Modify the chaos program so that the number of values to print is determined by the user. You will have to add a line near the top of the program to get another value from the user:

n = eval(input(“How many numbers should I print? ”))

Then you will need to change the loop to use n instead of a specific number.

-------
Code

def main():
    print("This program illustrates a chaotic function")
    x = eval(input("Enter a number between 0 and 1: "))
    n = eval(input("How many numbers should I print? "))
    for i in range(n) :
        x = 3.9 * x * (1 - x)
        print(x)
main()
