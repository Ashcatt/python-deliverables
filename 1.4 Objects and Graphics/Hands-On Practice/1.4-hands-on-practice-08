8. Line Segment Information.
This program allows the user to draw a line segment and then displays some graphical and textual information about the line segment. 

Input: 		Two mouse clicks for the end points of the line segment.
Output: 	Draw the midpoint of the segment in cyan.
Draw the line.
Print the length and the slope of the line.
Formulas:	dx=x2-x1
dy=y2-y1
slope=dy/dx
length=dx2+dy2
