1. Alter the program from the last discussion question in the following ways:

(a) Make it draw squares instead of circles.
(b) Have each successive click draw an additional square on the screen (rather than moving the existing one).
(c) Print a message on the window "Click again to quit" after the loop, and wait for a final click before closing the window.
