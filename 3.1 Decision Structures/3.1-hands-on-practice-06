6. The speeding ticket fine policy in Lazytown is $50 plus $5 for each mph over the limit plus a penalty of $200
for any speed over 90 mph. Write a program that accepts a speed limit and a clocked speed and either prints a message
indicating the speed was legal or prints the amount of the fine, if the speed is illegal.

    # get speed limit
    limit = eval(input("Enter the speed limit (mph): "))
    # get clocked speed
    speed = eval(input("Enter the clocked speed (mph): "))

    fine = 0

    if speed > limit:
        fine += 50 + ((speed - limit) * 5)
        if speed > 90:
            fine += 200
            print("\nThis is illegal. The fine is ${0}".format(fine))
