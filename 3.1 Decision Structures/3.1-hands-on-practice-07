7. A babysitter charges $2.50 an hour until 9:00 PM when the rate drops to $1.75 an hour (the children are in bed).
Write a program that accepts a starting time and ending time in hours and minutes and calculates the total babysitting bill.
You may assume that the starting and ending times are in a single 24-hour period. Partial hours should be appropriately prorated.

    for i in range((end+1)-start):

        else:
            total += 2.50 # add normal salary
        end1 += 1
        
    # outcome
    print("\nThe bill will be: $",total)
