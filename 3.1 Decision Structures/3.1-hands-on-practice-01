# This program calculates the weekly wage, plus overtime, for a job.

def main():

    # get hourly rate
    rate = eval(input("Enter hourly rate: "))
    # get hours worked

    if hour > 40: # if overtime
        # get wage + overtime
        wage = (hour * rate) + (((hour - 40) * rate) * .5)
    else: # else get wage
        wage = hour * rate
