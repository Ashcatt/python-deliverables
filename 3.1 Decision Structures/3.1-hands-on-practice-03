3. An instructor gives 100-point exams that are graded on the scale 90-100:A, 80-89:B, 70-79:C, 60-69:0, <60:F.
Write a program that accepts an exam score as input and uses a decision structure to calculate the corresponding grade.

# This program finds the letter grade of a 100-point exam

def main():
    # get the quiz score
    quizScore = eval(input("This program finds the letter grade of a 100-point exam\nEnter an exam score (0-100): "))

    # get letterGrade using decision structure
    if quizScore < 60:
        letter = "F"
    elif quizScore >= 60 and quizScore <= 69:
        letter = "D" # note: the instructions said, "60-69:0" However, I believe
                     #       this to be a mistake where 0 is meant to be D
    elif quizScore >= 70 and quizScore <= 79:
        letter = "C"
    elif quizScore >= 80 and quizScore <= 89:
        letter = "B"
    elif quizScore >= 90 and quizScore <= 100:
        letter = "A"

    # output letter grade
    print("The exam grade is {0}".format(letter))
