5. The body mass index (BMI) is calculated as a person's weight (in pounds) times 720, divided by
the square of the person's height (in inches). A BMI in the range 19-25, inclusive, is considered healthy.
Write a program that calculates a person's BMI and prints a message telling whether they are above, within,
or below the healthy range.
