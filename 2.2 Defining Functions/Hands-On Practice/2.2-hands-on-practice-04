4. Write definitions for the following two functions:

sumN(n) returns the sum of the first n natural numbers.
sumNCubes(n) returns the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers.

Then use these functions in a program that prompts a user for an n and
prints out the sum of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers.
