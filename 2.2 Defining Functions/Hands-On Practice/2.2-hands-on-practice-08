# This program guesses the square root of a number.

def nextGuess(guess,x):
    # get loopFor
    loopFor = eval(input("How many times should the program improve it's guess? "))

    # calculate guess
    for i in range(loopFor):
        guess = (guess + (x / guess)) / 2
    return guess

def main():
    # get x
    x = eval(input("Enter a number to find it's square root: "))

    guess = x / 2

    # get outcome
    guess = nextGuess(guess,x)
    # outcome
    print("The estimated square root of",x,"is",guess)
