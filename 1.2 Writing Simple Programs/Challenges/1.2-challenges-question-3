# A simple program that calculates the batting average of a baseball player based
# on user input.

def main():
	# Take input from the user
	player_name = input("What's the player's name? " )
	hit_amount = input("How many hits?" )
	batting_amount = input("How many at-bats?" )
	# Calculates batting average
	batting_average = hit amount / batting_amount
	print(player_name+"'s batting average is", batting_average)
main()
