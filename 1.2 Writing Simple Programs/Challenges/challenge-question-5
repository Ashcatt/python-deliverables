5. The Mars Curiosity rover takes photos of the Mars surface, and then transmits them to NASA at the speed of light. Light travels at about 186,000 miles per second. Write a program to calculate how long it takes a photo from Curiosity to reach NASA when Mars is at its closest orbit to Earth, a distance of about 34 million miles.
