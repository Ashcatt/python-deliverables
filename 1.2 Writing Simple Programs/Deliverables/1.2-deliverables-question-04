# A looped program to convert Celsius temps to Fahrenheit.

def main():
	# Prompts user for the amount of times the program should loop
	repeat = eval(input("How many times would you like to repeat this program? "))
	print("")
	# Temperature conversion loop
	for x in range(repeat):
		# User input celsius temp
		celsius = eval(input("What is the Celsius temperature? "))
		# Convert celsius to fahrenheit
		fahrenheit = 9 / 5 * celsius + 32
		# Caclulation output
		print("The temperature is", fahrenheit, "degrees Fahrenheit.")
		print("")
main ()
