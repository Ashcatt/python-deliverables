Write an interactive Python calculator program. The program should allow the user to type a mathematical expression, and then print the value of the expression. Include a loop so that the user can perform many calculations (say, up to 100). Note: To quit early, the user can make the program crash by typing a bad expression or simply closing the window that the calculator program is running in. You'll learn better ways of terminating interactive programs in later chapters.

def main():

        print("Press <Enter> or close the window to exit")
	# loops 100 times
        for i in range(100):

                expression = eval(input("Enter your expression: "))
                print("The answer is", expression)'
	# Exit text
        print("You've reached the limit of calculations per one instance.")
        input("Press <Enter> to exit ")
main()
